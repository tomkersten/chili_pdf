# ChiliPDF Plugin - Flexible PDF exporting for ChiliProject/Redmine

## Experimental repository!!

I am in the middle of getting this to a stable state. The installation
process is not standard, nore is it properly documented. Additionally,
it still requires manual patches to the base Redmine/ChiliProject application
in order to function.

In short, you likely **do not want to install it at this point...**

## DESCRIPTION:

ChiliProject (/Redmine) plugin which implements/enhances PDF-export functionality using the Webkit rendering engine (via the 'wkhtmltopdf' executable).

## NOTABLE ITEMS TO CONSIDER

1. This plugin is distributed as a gem, but does ship with migrations
   and asset files (stylesheets, etc). Therefore, the installation
   procedure is not the standard process.
